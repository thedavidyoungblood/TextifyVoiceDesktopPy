# TextifyVoice - Audio and Video Transcription with Whisper

**TextifyVoice** is a practical application that combines OpenAI's Whisper ASR model with a simple and intuitive graphical interface. It serves as a versatile tool for transcribing audio and video, allowing users to easily convert spoken language into written text.

Initially, I used the Whisper library locally on my computer, handling files solely through the command prompt. However, as requests for using Whisper to transcribe videos became more frequent, I realized that this need was shared by others. Thus, the idea emerged to create a more accessible solution for those who do not frequently interact with technology‚Äîespecially for those who feel intimidated by using the command prompt. The solution was to develop a desktop application with two main advantages: it is free and enables transcriptions without the need for an internet connection.

## üöÄ Features

- **Audio and Video Transcription**: Easily convert audio or video files into text.
- **Intuitive Graphical Interface**: Select and transcribe files through a user-friendly interface.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Compatible with formats such as MP3, MP4, WAV, AAC, FLAC, M4A, OGG, among others.
- **Customizable Model Download**: Choose from different transcription models based on your needs.
- **Optimized Audio Processing**: Utilizes FFmpeg to extract audio tracks from video files.
- **Automatic Saving**: Transcriptions are saved as `.docx` files in the same directory as the original files.
- **Process Cancellation**: Ability to cancel ongoing model downloads and transcriptions.

## üìú Requirements

### Compatible Operating Systems:

| Operating System | Pre-compiled Executable | As Python Module | From Git |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows** | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| **macOS** | ‚ùå | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| **Linux** | ‚ùå | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚úîÔ∏è |

\*Estimated time to transcribe 1 hour of audio. May vary depending on hardware.

## üîß Installation

**FFmpeg**

There are two files for installation, `install_ffmpeg_profile.ps1` (installation at the current user level) and `install_ffmpeg_adm.ps1` (installation at the administrator level). These PowerShell scripts were created to facilitate the FFmpeg installation process, an essential program for file conversion during the application's use.

There is also a way to install manually [HERE](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows).

### Pre-compiled Executable

1. **Download**: Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/finnzao/TextifyVoiceDesktopPy/releases/tag/v1).
2. **Installation**: Extract the downloaded file.
3. **Execution**: Run the `TextifyVoice.exe` file.
4. **Configuration**: On the first run, configure the preferences according to your needs.
5. **Usage**: Start transcribing your files!
